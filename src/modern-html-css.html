# Face of Modern Web-App

---

## What? Why?

A lot of modern apps use the web browser for UI rendering. The last few years brought
a bunch of changes/additions to used technologies. This is an overview of those
changes/additions with small examples.

# HTML5

???
* Gonna talk about presentation only, not programming APIs

---

## Scope

We'll explore the following:

* Semantic sectioning
* Form extensions
* Media inclusion
* `iframe` sandboxing

---

## HTML5 - Paradigm Shift

HTML5 changes were in general prompted by changes to what it was being used for and how.

#### HTML 4.01 (1999)

* Serving content-oriented web _pages_
* Single static page contains single chunk of content
* Interaction logic resides in back-end

#### HTML5 (2014)

* Serving interaction-oriented web _applications_
* Interspersed content and interactions
* Document can contain whole application and mutate continuously

---

## Semantic Sectioning

HTML4 offered only rough & imprecise document structuring - heading hierarchy.
HTML5 provides fleshed-out, modular document outline mechanism - sectioning.

* Sectioning: `<body>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`
* Section-related: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<address>`
* Sectioning roots: `<blockquote>`, `<details>`, `<fieldset>`, `<figure>`, `<td>`

Precise complex sectioning should help assistive technologies, readers, etc.

---

### HTML4 Outline

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
```

---

### HTML5 Outline

```html

```

---

## Form Extensions

---

## Media Inclusion

---

## IFrame sandboxing

---

## CSS3

* what? (how? where?)
* box-sizing
* resets: initial, unset, all
* calculations: calc, attr
* colors
* selectors, pseudo-elements
* borders, backgrounds, shadows
* fonts
* transitions, animations, transforms
* layouts: multi-column, flexbox, grid
* future: scoped stylesheets, shapes, exclusions, masking, blending, fragmentation

---

## HTML + CSS

* CSS preprocessors (Sass)
* using edge features (autoprefixer)
* CSS in JS

---

## Responsive UI

* media queries!
* font-relative & viewport-relative units
* layout re-ordering

---

## Accessibility

* sane structuring
* WAI-ARIA
