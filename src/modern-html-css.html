# Face of Modern Web-App

---

## What? Why?

A lot of modern apps use the web browser for UI rendering. The last few years brought
a bunch of changes/additions to used technologies. This is an overview of those
changes/additions.

# HTML5

???
* gonna talk about presentation only, not programming APIs

---

## Scope

We'll explore the following:

* Semantic sectioning
* Form extensions
* Media inclusion
* `iframe` sandboxing

---

## HTML5 - Paradigm Shift

HTML5 changes were in general prompted by changes to what it was being used for and how.

#### HTML 4.01 (1999)

* Serving content-oriented web _pages_
* Single static page contains single chunk of content
* Interaction logic resides in back-end

#### HTML5 (2014)

* Serving interaction-oriented web _applications_
* Interspersed content and interactions
* Document can contain whole application and mutate continuously

---

## Semantic Sectioning

HTML4 offered only rough & imprecise document structuring - heading hierarchy.
HTML5 provides fleshed-out, modular document outline mechanism - sectioning.

* Sectioning: `<body>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`
* Section-related: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<address>`
* Sectioning roots: `<blockquote>`, `<details>`, `<fieldset>`, `<figure>`, `<td>`

Precise complex sectioning should help assistive technologies, readers, etc.

---

### HTML4 Outline

```html
<div class="section" id="forest-elephants" >
*  <h1>Forest elephants</h1>
  <p>In this section, we discuss the lesser known forest elephants.
    ...this section continues...</p>
  <div class="subsection" id="forest-habitat" >
*    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p>Forest elephants do not live in trees but among them.
     ...this subsection continues...</p>
  </div>
*  <h3>Mongolian gerbils</h2>
  <p>In this section, we discuss the famous mongolian gerbils.
   ...this subsection continues...</p>
</div>
```

1. Forest elephants
    1. Habitat
        1. Mongolian gerbils

---

### HTML5 Outline

```html
<section>
*  <h1>Forest elephants</h1>
  <p>In this section, we discuss the lesser known forest elephants.
    ...this section continues...</p>
  <section>
*    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p>Forest elephants do not live in trees but among them.
        ...this subsection continues...</p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
*  <h3>Mongolian gerbils</h3>
  <p>In this section, we discuss the famous mongolian gerbils.
     ...this section continues...</p
</section>
```

1. Forest elephants
    1. Habitat
1. Mongolian gerbils

???
mention `<aside>` & `<nav>` (outside outline) and sectioning roots, if not explained already

---

## Form Extensions

Various form features have been added directly to HTML5 to provide unified experience across
devices & make sense even to screen readers.

* new input types: `email`, `date`, `color`, `number`, `range`, `search`, `tel`, `time`, `url`, ...
* new attributes: `placeholder`, `autofocus`, `autocomplete`, `list`, `autosave`, `form`, ...
* validation: `min`, `max`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, `pattern`, `required`, ...

Scripting is no longer required for most of the form behavior patterns.

---

## Media Inclusion

HTML5 recognizes the need for direct embedding of media and their consumption on various
types of devices.

Efficient image import:
```html
<picture>
    <source srcset="sample-image-m.png,600w">
    <source srcset="sample-image-xl.png" media="(min-width: 1200px)">
    <source srcset="sample-image-xxl.png,1600w,2x">
    <img src="sample-image.png" alt="sample image">
</video>
```

Audio/video embedding:
```html
<video controls preload="auto" loop autoplay>
    <source src="sample-video.ogv" type="video/ogv; codecs=dirac, speex">
    <source src="sample-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.
</video>
```

---

## IFrame sandboxing

`<iframe>` received some upgrades allowing easy sandboxing or document nesting.

* `sandbox` - restriction flags like `allow-scripts`, `allow-forms`, `allow-modals`, `allow-same-origin`, ...
* `seamless` - seamless integration (styles, links, ...)
* `srcdoc` - provide content directly

Using all of the above allows e.g. seamlessly embedding 3rd party content, sandboxing ads or `eval()`,
scoping stylesheets, etc.

---

## More...

* `<mark>`, `<figure>`, `<data>`, `<time>`, `<output>`, `<progress>`, `<main>`, ...
* web sockets, push events, offline cache, persistent storage, canvas, webGL, SVG, ...

[... ... ... MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)

???
maybe talk about browser support of HTLM5 features

---

## CSS3

* what? (how? where?)
* box-sizing
* resets: initial, unset, all
* calculations: calc, attr
* colors
* selectors, pseudo-elements
* borders, backgrounds, shadows
* fonts
* transitions, animations, transforms
* layouts: multi-column, flexbox, grid
* future: scoped stylesheets, shapes, exclusions, masking, blending, fragmentation

---

## HTML + CSS

* CSS preprocessors (Sass)
* using edge features (autoprefixer)
* CSS in JS

---

## Responsive UI

* media queries!
* font-relative & viewport-relative units
* layout re-ordering

---

## Accessibility

* sane structuring
* WAI-ARIA
